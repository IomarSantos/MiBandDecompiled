# MiBandDecompiled
This is an attempt to decompile Xiaomi Mi Band official application

# Current status
Now we can build and run the app successfully.
App is launching successfully.
But it is crashing on the screen after login to xiaomi

I belive its some conflict in confuguration files and external libraries.

Any help is welcomed
